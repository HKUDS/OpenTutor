  title: "Refactor PromptManager Singleton"
  description: "The PromptManager is a singleton with global state, causing test fragility and preventing parallel execution. Refactor to use dependency injection, removing the singleton pattern and updating consumers to accept a PromptManager instance. This will improve testability and state isolation."

  title: "Separate PromptManager Unit and Integration Tests"
  description: "The test suite for PromptManager mixes unit and integration tests by reading from the live filesystem. This makes tests brittle. Split the tests into two suites: 1) Unit tests that mock filesystem I/O (`pathlib.Path.read_text`) to test the manager's logic in isolation. 2) Integration tests in `tests/integration/prompts/` that validate the schema and content of the actual `.yaml` prompt files."
